    If a build fails for a reason that cannot be immediately fixed,
    immediate rescheduling may cause a very tight loop.
    combined with publishers like e-mail, IM, this could flood the users.
    <p>
    So to avoid this problem, progressively introduce delay (in sec) until the next build.
    The delay starts with the <em>increment</em> value,then it is grows by the
    <tt>increment * number of consecutive failures</tt>
    (e.g. starting with 5, it takes 10, 20, 35, 55 ...etc... up to the max value)
    then the delay value remains the <em>max</em>.
